# Feather Fall: Forecasting Conservation Risk Levels for Birds in India
## Problem Statement 
##### India is home to over 1,300 bird species, many of which are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and human activity. With conservation resources limited, it's critical to prioritize efforts toward species that are most at risk. However, determining which species need immediate attention remains a significant challenge.
##### This project aims to build a machine learning model that classifies Indian bird species into three conservation concern levels — Low, Moderate, or High — using ecological traits, population trends, migratory behavior, diet, and other biological indicators. By leveraging data-driven predictions, this tool supports early identification of vulnerable species, enabling conservationists and policymakers to take targeted, proactive action. Through this approach, we seek to enhance the effectiveness of conservation planning and contribute to preserving India's avian biodiversity.

## Goal 
##### To support effective bird conservation in India by identifying species at higher conservation risk through predictive modeling, enabling early intervention and better resource allocation.

## Project Objective 
##### To build a machine learning model that classifies Indian bird species into conservation concern levels (Low, Moderate, High) using ecological features such as population trends, diet type, migratory behavior, and distribution range. This model will help prioritize species and regions for focused conservation action
